- **2025-11-29** 
  – Added `evidence_mode` flag with 'strict' setting and defined behaviour in case of failure to obtain necessary information.
  - Added standardized section warning messages for missing/empty sections and sections that are too short. (< 50 words)
  - Clarified integration points with Module 02 (section loop) and added metadata tags to be produced in these cases.

3. Guardrails
• Enforce strict evidence mode (summaries only from provided text)
• Generate warnings for missing/empty/short sections
• Block hallucinations and flag insufficient evidence

• Strict Evidence Mode
  • If evidence_mode = "strict" → only include claims, equations, and results that appear in the provided text.
  • If summarizer cannot find enough information → output:
  “The source text does not provide enough detail to summarize this section in strict evidence mode.”
  • Do not generate a summary when evidence is insufficient.
• Section Warning Messages
  • If a section is missing/empty → output:
    “Section skipped due to no usable text being provided.”
  • If a section is too short (< 50 words) → output:
    “Section very short: summary may be incomplete.”
