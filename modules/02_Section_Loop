## Change Log
- **2025-11-28** – Added `summary_level` variable and implemented two summary modes:
  - `summary_level = "short"` → 1–2 sentence compact summary per section.
  - `summary_level = "detailed"` → short paragraph plus 3–5 key-point bullet list per section.
  Updated section loop instructions to include conditional behavior for both modes.

2. Section Loop
• Extract text for each section.
• Read the `summary_level` variable for the current run.
• Apply summary-level logic for each section:
  ◦ If `summary_level = "short"` → generate only a compact summary of **1–2 sentences** for that section (no bullet list).
  ◦ If `summary_level = "detailed"` → generate a **short paragraph** plus a **bullet list of 3–5 key points** for that section.
